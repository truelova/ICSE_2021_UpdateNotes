the second bug was that attack animations with multiple splash attack zones would do multiplicative damage in correlation with the number of splash zones. so a unit which deals 100 damage but has 2 splash zones could deal up to 200 damage (100 for each zone). this has now been altered in order to mitigate the extra damage provided from additional splash zones. each subsequent splash zone now has diminishing returns by dealing less damage than the previous one (but only if the previous zone did damage to an entity),Total War: WARHAMMER II,2020-05-19,1,value
